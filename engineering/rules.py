Thumb-rule constants and default engineering assumptions used by

These are typical values used in preliminary/conceptual estimation for
small residential RCC buildings (South Asian - Pakistani/Indian - practice,
commonly cited in estimation textbooks and PWD/DSR-style guidance). They are DEFAULTS
ONLY — every one of them is editable from the Streamlit UI (Step 3's
"Engineering assumptions" panel for the thumb rules and key heights/
thicknesses; Step 5 for rates and wastage) before the BOQ is finalized, and none of them should be treated as a structural design
input.

Where a rule is a range in common practice, we pick the mid-point as the
default and note the range in the `note`/help text shown in the UI.

# on top of the rate-book's finish-sensitive rates - Flooring, Painting,
# Plaster, Doors, Windows, Electrical, Plumbing & Sanitary, Kitchen (see
# mto_boq/boq_generator.py:generate_boq). The rate book's own default rates
# (data/material_rates.json) represent the "Standard" tier, so Standard is
# always a 1.00x no-op.
#
# Multipliers are derived from researched September-2026 Pakistani market
# price spreads (material + labour, PKR/sqft, converted to the ratio
# between tiers so they're independent of any single rate-book edit):
#   - Flooring: economy ceramic tile (~PKR 120-450/sqft) vs mid-range
#     vitrified/porcelain (~PKR 350-1,000+/sqft) vs premium imported
#     porcelain/marble (~PKR 800-2,500+/sqft installed).
#   - Painting: budget distemper (~PKR 40-90/sqft applied) vs mid-range
#     plastic emulsion (~PKR 90-160/sqft applied) vs premium weathershield/
#     texture finishes (~PKR 160-250+/sqft applied).
#   - Plaster: single-coat rendering (~PKR 64-92/sqft) vs smooth
#     double-coat finish-ready plaster (~PKR 86-125/sqft, the rate book's
#     "Standard") vs a premium/waterproof + wall-putty finish (~PKR
#     100-145+/sqft, plus an allowance for putty/corner-beading work not
#     separately broken out in these sources).
#   - Doors: economy flush/PVC door with basic frame (~PKR 8,000-12,000/
#     door + hardware) vs mid-range semi-solid/veneer door (~PKR 25,000-
#     35,000/door + frame, the rate book's "Standard" at PKR 35,000) vs
#     solid Deodar/Sheesham/Mahogany (~PKR 45,000-130,000+/door) - door
#     prices vary hugely by wood species, so this spread is wide by nature.
#   - Windows: economy fixed aluminium (~PKR 1,200-1,800/sqft) vs
#     standard sliding/casement aluminium (~PKR 1,500-2,500+/sqft, the
#     rate book's "Standard") vs thermal-break/UPVC premium glazing
#     (~PKR 3,500-5,500/sqft).
# These are indicative MVP-level multipliers, not a substitute for actual
# material-brand quotations - like every other default in this app, they
# are meant to get a preliminary estimate "in the right ballpark," and the
# rate book itself remains fully editable in Step 5.
#   - Electrical / Plumbing & Sanitary / Kitchen (added with the MEP
#     module): economy local fittings vs mid-range branded vs premium
#     imported fittings/cabinetry - indicative spreads only.
